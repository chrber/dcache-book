<title>gPlazma authorization in dCache</title>
<partauthors>Ted Hesselroth</partauthors>


  <para>
gPlazma is a cell in dCache that authorizes users. Cells make requests to gPlazma by submitting user credential information to it, receiving the authorization decision and site-specific user information such as uid, gid, and rootpath in return.
  </para> 

  <para>
The acronym stands for Grid-aware PLuggable AuthoriZation Management, and supports the use of plugins which implement various selectable authorization methods. The four currently-available methods are:
  </para>

<itemizedlist spacing="compact">
 <listitem>
  <para>
kpwd : This is the "legacy" method. The dcache.kpwd file is used to map a user's DN to a local username, and the same file is used in a second mapping of the username to the uid, gid, and rootpath. As in all methods, if the mappings succeed, file system access is done using the obtained uid and gid, and a check is done that the local path of the transfer starts with the designated rootpath.
  </para>
 </listitem>

 <listitem>
  <para>
grid-mapfile : This method employs a grid mapfile. From the mapfile, the user's DN is mapped to a username. A second file, storage-authdb, is used for the mapping of the username to the uid, gid, and rootpath.
  </para>
 </listitem>
 
 <listitem>
  <para>
gplazmalite-vorole-mapping : In this method the mapping to the username is done from the concatenation of the user's DN with the user's Role (or, more precisely, with the user's Fully Qualified Attribute Name). The mapping of username to uid, gid, and rootpath is through the storage-authdb file.
  </para>
 </listitem>
 
 <listitem>
  <para>
saml-vo-mapping : The DN and Role are mapped to a username via a callout to a <ulink
  url="http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS/">GUMS</ulink> server. The GUMS service may run an extension which returns the uid, gid, and rootpath as well. Otherwise, the mapping of username to uid, gid, and rootpath is through the storage-authdb file. 
  </para>
 </listitem>
</itemizedlist>


<para>The following describes how to use gPlazma in dCache.
</para>


  


<section>
 <title>Installation</title>


<para>
gPlazma is included in dCache version 1.7 or higher. As of that version,the gPlazma cell can be called from gridftp doors and the srm server . 
</para>

<para>
For the dCache 1.7 version, there must be host certificates on the node running the gPlazma cell.
</para>

<para>
Depending on which authorization methods are to be used, some configuration files must be modified. The configuration files described here must exist on the node on which you wish to run the gPlazma cell and must contain the correct site-specific information for the dCache on which it is deployed. 
</para>

</section>

<section>
 <title>Configuring the gPlazma Policy File</title>
<para>
The gPlazma policy file, located in

<blockquote>
<programlisting width="80">
${ourHomeDir}/etc/dcachesrm-gplazma.policy        
</programlisting>
</blockquote>


controls which authorization plugins will be tried and the order in which they will be tried. The first of these is specified lines containing "ON" or "OFF" for each plugin, for example

<blockquote>
<programlisting width="80">
# Switches
saml-vo-mapping="ON"
kpwd="ON"
grid-mapfile="OFF"
gplazmalite-vorole-mapping="OFF"
</programlisting>
</blockquote>

The order is specified by assigning a different number to each plugin, such as

<blockquote>
<programlisting width="80">
# Priorities
saml-vo-mapping-priority="1"
kpwd-priority="3"
grid-mapfile-priority="4"
gplazmalite-vorole-mapping-priority="2"
</programlisting>
</blockquote>

In the above example, the saml-vo-mapping plugin would be tried first. If authorization was denied for that method, or if the authentication method itself failed, then the kpwd plugin would be tried. The "Priorities" numbering shows that if gplazmalite-vorole-mapping were to also be turned on, it would be tried after the saml-vo-mapping plugin and before the kpwd method.
</para>

<para>
Having more than one plugin turned on allows a plugin to be used as fallback for another plugin that may fail. It also allows for the authorization of special users who may be denied by the other methods. 
</para>

<para>
The policy file also contains a section for each of the plugins, for configuration specific to that plugin. These sections are described in the documentation for each plugin, as follows.
</para>

</section>

<section>
 <title>Configuring the kpwd Plugin</title>

<para>
The section in the gPlazma policy file for the kpwd plugin specifies the location of the dcache.kpwd file, for example

<blockquote>
<programlisting width="80">
# dcache.kpwd
kpwdPath="/opt/d-cache/etc/dcache.kpwd"
</programlisting>
</blockquote>

To maintain only one such file, make sure that this is the same location as defined in dCacheSetup.

Please see dCache documentation for <ulink   url="http://www.dcache.org/downloads/Release.notes1.6.5-2">dcache.kpwd</ulink> for how to create this file.
</para>

</section>

<section>
 <title>
Configuring the grid-mapfile Plugin
 </title>

<para>
Two file locations are defined in the policy file for this plugin:

<blockquote>
<programlisting width="80">
# grid-mapfile
gridMapFilePath="/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile"
storageAuthzPath="/etc/grid-security/storage-authzdb"
</programlisting>
</blockquote>

</para>


<section>
 <title>
Preparing the grid mapfile
 </title>

<para>


The grid mapfile is the same as that used in other applications. It can be created in various ways, either by connecting directly to VOMS or GUMS servers, or by hand.

Each line contains a DN (Certificate Subject) in quotes, and the username it is to be mapped to.

<blockquote>
<programlisting width="80">
"/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Gina Carlson 584065" uscms01
</programlisting>
</blockquote>

</para>

</section>

<section id='storage-authzdb-sect'>
 <title>
Preparing storage-authzdb
 </title>
 
<para>
This file is used to map the username to a site-specific uid, gid, and rootpath. It's location is

<blockquote>
<programlisting width="80">
/etc/grid-security/storage-authzdb
</programlisting>
</blockquote>

The file must contain a line specifying the version of the storage-authdb format.

<blockquote>
<programlisting width="80">
version 2.1
</programlisting>
</blockquote>



The other lines in the file each contain the string "authorize", followed by the username, read-write permission, uid, gid, and three paths. 

</para>

<para>
<emphasis role="bold">
authorize uscms01 read-write 60076 5063 / /pnfs/fnal.gov/resilient/uscms01 /pnfs/fnal.gov/resilient/uscms01
</emphasis>
</para>

<para>

In the storage-authzdb file, there must be a line for each username to be authorized. The use of three paths is for legacy puposes. Make the last two equal to the path under which the user is allowed to access files. It is permissible to simply use a "/" for the last two paths
</para>

<para>
<emphasis role="bold">
authorize uscms01 read-write 60076 5063 / / /
</emphasis>
</para>

<para>
in which case the user will be authorized for any path (the filesystem permissions in pnfs must also allow the transfer).
</para>

<para>
The lines are similar to the "login" lines of the dcache.kpwd file. If you alreay have a dcache.kwpd file, create storage-authzdb by taking the lines from your dcache.kpwd file that start with the word "login", for example,

</para>

<para>
<emphasis role="bold">
login uscms01 read-write 60076 5063 / /pnfs/fnal.gov/resilient/uscms01 /pnfs/fnal.gov/resilient/uscms01
</emphasis>
</para>

<para>
and replacing the word "login" with "authorize".




</para>
</section>

</section>

<section>
 <title>
Configuring the gplazmalite-vorole-mapping Plugin
 </title>

<para>
The gPlazma policy file contains two lines for this plugin.

<blockquote>
<programlisting width="80">
# Built-in gPLAZMAlite grid VO role mapping
gridVoRolemapPath="/etc/grid-security/grid-vorolemap"
gridVoRoleStorageAuthzPath="/etc/grid-security/storage-authzdb"
</programlisting>
</blockquote>

The second is the storage-authz-db used in other plugins. See the above documentation <link linkend='storage-authzdb-sect'>"Preparing storage-authzdb"</link> for how to create the file.

</para>


<section>
 <title>
Preparing grid-vorolemap
 </title>

<para>


The file is similar in format to the grid-mapfile, however there is a field following the DN (Certificate Subject), containing the Role (Fully Qualified Attribute Name)

<blockquote>
<programlisting width="80">
"/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Gina Carlson 584065" "/cms/uscms" uscms01
"/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Gina Carlson 584065" "/cms/uscms/Role=cmsprod" cmsprod
</programlisting>
</blockquote>

The same user can be mapped to different usernames depending on what their role is. The role is typically determined by how the user creates their proxy, for example, using voms-proxy-init. The FQAN contains the user's group, role (optional), and capability (optional). The latter two may be set to the string "NULL", in which case they will be ignored by the plugin.
</para>
</section>

<section>
 <title>
Authorizing a VO
 </title>

<para>

Instead of individual DNs, it is allowable to use * or "*" as the first field, such as

<blockquote>
<programlisting width="80">
"*" "/cms/uscms/Role=cmsprod" cmsprod
</programlisting>
</blockquote>

In that case, any DN with the corresponding role will match. It should be noted that a match is first attempted with the full DN. Therefore if both DN and "*" matches can be made, the DN match will take precedence. This is true for the revocation matches as well (see below).

Thus a user with subject

<blockquote>
<programlisting width="80">
"/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Ted Hesselroth 897321"
</programlisting>
</blockquote>

and role

<blockquote>
<programlisting width="80">
"/cms/uscms/Role=cmsprod"
</programlisting>
</blockquote>

will be mapped to username "cmsprod" via the above line with "*" for the DN, except if there is also a line such as

<blockquote>
<programlisting width="80">
"/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Ted Hesselroth 898521" "/cms/uscms/Role=cmsprod" uscms01
</programlisting>
</blockquote>

in which case the username will be "uscms01".
</para>
</section>

<section>
 <title>
Revocation Entries
 </title>

<para>
To create a revocation entry, add a line with "-" (without quotes) as the username, such as

<blockquote>
<programlisting width="80">
"/DC=org/DC=doegrids/OU=People/CN=Timur Perelmutov 623542" "/uscms/production" -
</programlisting>
</blockquote>

or modify the username of the entry if it already exists. The behaviour is undefined if there are two entries which differ only by username.

Since DN is matched first, if a user would be authorized by his VO membership through a "*" entry, but is matched according to his DN to a revocation entry, authorization would be denied. Likewise if a whole VO were denied in a revocation entry, but some user in that VO could be mapped to a username through his DN, then authorization would be granted.
</para>
</section>

</section>

<section>
 <title>
Configuring the saml-vo-mapping Plugin
 </title>

<para>
There is only one line in the policy file for this plugin, containing the URL for the GUMS web service.

<blockquote>
<programlisting width="80">
# SAML-based grid VO role mapping
mappingServiceUrl="https://fledgling09.fnal.gov:8448/gums/services/GUMSAuthorizationServicePort"
</programlisting>
</blockquote>

Replace the URL with that of the site-specific <ulink
  url="http://grid.racf.bnl.gov/GUMS/">GUMS</ulink> (the port is more likely to be 8443). When using the "GUMSAuthorizationServicePort", the service will only provide the username mapping and it will still be necesary to have the storage-authzdb file used in other plugins. See the above documentation <link linkend='storage-authzdb-sect'>"Preparing storage-authzdb"</link> for how to create the file. If a GUMS server providing a "StorageAuthorizationServicePort" with correct uid, gid, and rootpath information for your site is available, the storage-authzdb file is not necesary.
</para>

</section>
<section>
 <title>
An example policy file
 </title>

<para>
Here is an example of how a policy file might be set up.

<blockquote>
<programlisting width="80">
saml-vo-mapping="ON"
kpwd="ON"
grid-mapfile="OFF"
gplazmalite-vorole-mapping="OFF"
saml-vo-mapping-priority="1"
kpwd-priority="3"
grid-mapfile-priority="4"
gplazmalite-vorole-mapping-priority="2"
kpwdPath="/opt/d-cache/etc/dcache.kpwd"
gridMapFilePath="/etc/grid-security/grid-mapfile"
storageAuthzPath="/etc/grid-security/storage-authzdb"
mappingServiceUrl="https://fledgling09.fnal.gov:8443/gums/services/GUMSAuthorizationServicePort"
gridVoRolemapPath="/etc/grid-security/grid-vorolemap"
gridVoRoleStorageAuthzPath="/etc/grid-security/storage-authzdb" 
</programlisting>
</blockquote>

In this case, gPlazma will attempt to authorize first through a GUMS server, and fall back to using dcache.kpwd. The mappingServiceUrl would have to be changed to a GUMS server appropriate for the site.
</para>

</section>


<section>
 <title>
The Setup Files
 </title>

<para>Changes to Setup files require a restart of the cell.
</para>



<section>
 <title>
The gPlazmaSetup File
 </title>

<para>


This file will normally be a link to ${ourHomeDir}/config/dCacheSetup. The section of the file which controls the operation of the cell is as follows:

<blockquote>
<programlisting width="80">
gplazmaPolicy=${ourHomeDir}/etc/dcachesrm-gplazma.policy
#
# gPlazmaNumberOfSimutaneousRequests  30
# gPlazmaRequestTimeout               30
#
# useGPlazmaAuthorizationModule=false
# useGPlazmaAuthorizationCell=true
</programlisting>
</blockquote>


The first line defines the path to the gPlazma policy file. It is set to the default location of the policy file. If the path to the gPlazma policy file changes, enter the full path in the above line.

The variable gPlazmaNumberOfSimutaneousRequests determines the number of threads which will be started on the gPlazma cell to handle requests.The default value should be sufficient, but may be raised or lowered depending on the capacity of the hardware and other processes running on it.

The variable gPlazmaRequestTimeout is the amount of time in seconds that a request thread has to finish an authorization decision. If this time is exceeded, authorization is denied.

The next two variables are not used by gPlazma, but by gridftpdoor and SRM. Their description follows.


</para>

</section>

<section>
 <title>
The gridftpdoorSetup and srmSetup Files
 </title>

<para>

Thes two files will normally be links to ${ourHomeDir}/config/dCacheSetup. The lines of interest for gPlazma are

<blockquote>
<programlisting width="80">
gplazmaPolicy=${ourHomeDir}/etc/dcachesrm-gplazma.policy
</programlisting>
</blockquote>

and

<blockquote>
<programlisting width="80">
# useGPlazmaAuthorizationModule=false
# useGPlazmaAuthorizationCell=true
</programlisting>
</blockquote>


The latter two lines control whether the gridftpdoor or SRM will authorize locally, or use the gPlazma cell for authorization. The default is to use the gPlazma cell for authorization. If both values are set to "false", the gridftpdoor or SRM will use the dcache.kpwd lookup method. A dcache.kpwd file must be present on the gridftpdoor or SRM node in that case. It is possible to use gPlazma methods on the door or SRM without calling the gPlazma cell. See the following section.

</para>

</section>

</section>


<section>
 <title>
Using Direct Calls of gPlazma Methods
 </title>

<para>Cells may also call gPlazma methods as an alternative, or as a fallback, to using the gPlazma cell.
</para>

<section>
 <title>
Operation without a gPlazma Cell
 </title>

<para>


If the GPLAZMA cell is not started, other cells can still authorize by calling gplazma methods directly from a pluggable module. The gplazma control files and host certificates are needed on the node from which authorization will take place. To invoke the gplazma modules, modify the following line in gridftpdoorSetup or srmSetup to

<blockquote>
<programlisting width="80">
useGPlazmaAuthorizationModule=true
</programlisting>
</blockquote>

and make sure that the gplazmaPolicy line defines a valid gplazma policy file on the node for which authorization is to occur:

<blockquote>
<programlisting width="80">
gplazmaPolicy=${ourHomeDir}/etc/dcachesrm-gplazma.policy
</programlisting>
</blockquote>


No adjustable timeout is available, but any blocking would likely be due to a socket read in the saml-vo-mapping plugin, which is circumvented by a built-in 30-second timeout.
</para>

</section>


<section>
 <title>
Using a gPlazma Cell with a Direct-Call Fallback
 </title>

<para>

Both a call to the GPLAZMA cell and the direct call of the gplazma module may be specified. In that case, authentication will first be tried via the GPLAZMA cell, and if that does not succeed, authentication by direct invocation of gplazma methods will be tried. Modify the following lines to: 

<blockquote>
<programlisting width="80">
useGPlazmaAuthorizationModule=true
useGPlazmaAuthorizationCell=true
</programlisting>
</blockquote>


Make sure that the line for gplazmaPolicy

<blockquote>
<programlisting width="80">
gplazmaPolicy=${ourHomeDir}/etc/dcachesrm-gplazma.policy
</programlisting>
</blockquote>

set to a local policy file on the node. The gplazma policy file on the gridftp door or SRM does not have to specify the same plugins as the gPlazma cell.

</para>
