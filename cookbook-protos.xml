    <title>Access to SRM and GridFTP server from behind a firewall</title>

    <para>
      When files are transfered in gridftp active mode from gridftp
      server to the gridftp client, server establishes data channel(s)
      by connecting to the client. In this case client creates a tcp
      socket, bound to some particular address on the client host, and
      sends the client host ip and port to the server. If the client
      host is running a firewall, firewall might refuse server's
      connection to the client's listening socket.  Common solution to
      this problem is establishing a range of ports on the client's
      host that are allowed to be connected from Internet by changing
      firewall rules.Once the port range is defined the client can be
      directed to use one of the ports from the port ranges when
      creating listening tcp sockets.

      <title>Access with srmcp</title>

      <para>
	If you are using srmcp as a client you need to do the
	following:

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      create a directory $HOME/.globus if it does not exist
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      create and/or edit a file
	      $HOME/.globus/cog.properties by appending a new
	      line reading

<programlisting>tcp.port.range=<replaceable>min</replaceable>,<replaceable>max</replaceable></programlisting>

	      where <replaceable>min</replaceable> and
	      <replaceable>max</replaceable> are the lower and upper
	      bounds of the port range.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

      </para>

    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Access with globus-url-copy</title>

      <para>
	If you are transferring files from gridftp server using
	<command>globus-url-copy</command>, you need to define an
	environment variable <varname>GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE</varname>,
	in the same shell in which <command>globus-url-copy</command>
	will be executed.
      </para>

      <para>
	In sh/bash you do that by invoking the following command:

<screen><userprompt/>export GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE="<replaceable>min</replaceable>,<replaceable>max</replaceable>"</screen>

	in csh/tcsh you invoke:

<screen><userprompt/>setenv GLOBUS_TCP_PORT_RANGE "<replaceable>min</replaceable>,<replaceable>max</replaceable>"</screen>

	here <replaceable>min</replaceable> and
	<replaceable>max</replaceable> are again the lower and upper
	bounds of the port range
      </para>

  <section id="cb-proto-dis-dcap">
    <title>Disableing unauthenticated dCap via SRM</title>
    
    <!-- 
    <para>
      NOCLUE: Meta-intro? Where to put this? A more general section about
      protocolls in Configuration?
    </para> 
    -->

    <para>
      In some cases SRM transfers fail because they are tried via
      the plain dCap protocol (URL starts with
      <literal>dcap://</literal>). Since plain dCap is
      unauthenticated, the dCache server will have no information
      about the user trying to access the system. While the transfer
      will succeed if the UNIX file permissions allow access to
      anybody (e.g. mode 777), it will fail otherwise. 
    </para>
    
    <para>
      Usually all doors are registered in SRM as potential access
      points for dCache. During a protocol negotiation the SRM
      chooses one of the available doors. You can force srmcp to use
      the gsidcap protocol (<option>-protocol=gsidcap</option>) or
      you can unregister plain, unauthenticated dCap from known
      protocols: From the file
      <filename>config/door.batch</filename> remove
      <option>-loginBroker=LoginBroker</option> and restart dcap
      door with
      
<screen><rootprompt/>jobs/door stop
<rootprompt/>jobs/door -logfile=<replaceable>dCacheLocation</replaceable>/log/door.log start</screen>
