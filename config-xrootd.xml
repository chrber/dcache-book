  <para>
    This chapter explains how to configure &dcache; in order to access
    it via the &xrootd; protocol, allowing &xrootd;-Clients like
    ROOT's TXNetfile and xrdcp to do file operations against a
    &dcache; instance in a transparent manner. The current
    implementation in &dcache; 1.9.9 is based on the most recent
    production version of the &xrootd; protocol (2.9.6).
  </para>

  <section id="cf-xrootd-setup">
    <title>Setting up</title>

    <para>
      The xrootd functionality is contained in all &dcache; releases
      starting from 1.7.0. Versions prior to this are not supported!
    </para>

    <para>
      To allow file transfers in and out of &dcache; using xrootd, a
      new &door-xrootd; must be started. This door acts then as the
      entry point to all &xrootd; requests.  Compared to the native
      xrootd server-implementation (produced by SLAC), the
      &door-xrootd; refers to the <literal>redirector node</literal>.
    </para>

    <para>
      To enable the &door-xrootd;, you have to change the layout file
      corresponding to your &dcache;-instance.  Enable the
      xrootd-service within the domain that you want to run it by adding the
      following line
    </para>

    <programlisting>..
[<replaceable>domainName</replaceable>/xrootd]
..</programlisting>

    <informalexample>
    <para>
        For example, if your &dcache;-instance is configured to be a head-node
        and you want to run the &door-xrootd; within the
        <literal>xrootd-${host.name}Domain</literal>, add/uncomment the
        following lines in <filename>${dCacheHome}/etc/layouts/head.conf</filename>:
    </para>

        <programlisting>..
[xrootd-${host.name}Domain]
[xrootd-${host.name}Domain/xrootd]
..</programlisting>

    </informalexample>

    <para>
      After a restart of the domain running the &door-xrootd;, done e.g. by
      executing
    </para>

    <screen>&prompt-root; <userinput>${dCacheHome}/bin/dcache restart xrootd-babelfishDomain</userinput>
Stopping xrootd-babelfishDomain (pid=30246) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 done
Starting xrootd-babelfishDomain done</screen>

    <para>
      the &door-xrootd; should be running. A few minutes later it
      should appear at the web monitoring interface under "Cell
      Services" (see <xref linkend="intouch-web" />).
    </para>

    <warning>
      <para>
	Starting from version 1.7.0 (patchlevel 20), the &door-xrootd;
	is set to readonly by default. In prior versions, the door is
	started in unsecure mode, giving clients unrestricted read and
	write access.  Please refer to <xref linkend="cf-xrootd-sec"/>
	on how to setup security.

      For controlling the &tcp;-portrange within which new &xrootd;-movers

      <literal>net.lan.port.min</literal> and
      <literal>net.lan.port.max</literal> to
      <filename>${dCacheHome}/etc/dcache.conf</filename> and adapt them

    <note>
      <para>
        Since &dcache; version 1.9.10, the number of simultaneously active
        &xrootd;-movers of one &dcache;-instance is not limited by the
        configured portrange anymore.
        The reason for this is that &dcache; now uses
        <firstterm>UUIDs</firstterm> included in the &xrootd;-redirect to match
        the requests on the pool-side to the requests issued to the door.

	Please note that due to the unauthenticated nature of this

	subdirectory in the &pnfs; namespace (including the automatic

	generated through &xrootd; will inherit UID/GID from its
	parent directory.

    <section id="cf-xrootd-sec-selected">
      <title>Permitting read/write access on selected &pnfs; directories</title>

      <para>
	To overcome the security issue of uncontrolled &xrootd; read and write
	access mentioned in the previous section, it is possible to
	restrict read and write access on a per-directory basis (including
	subdirectories). This feature is available from &dcache;
	1.7.0-36 on for controlling write access and since version 1.9.8-1 for
	controlling read access.
      </para>

      <para>
	To activate this feature, a colon-seperated list containing
	the full &pnfs; paths of authorized directories must be added
	to <filename>${dCacheHome}/etc/dcache.conf</filename>. If both read and
	write access should be authorized for certain directories, add the
	following line to <filename>${dCacheHome}/etc/dcache.conf</filename>:
      </para>

..</programlisting>

       <para>
        If you want to split permissions depending on whether the operation is
        reading or writing, add the following lines instead:

xrootdAllowedReadPaths=/pnfs/<replaceable>example.org</replaceable>/rpath1:/pnfs/<replaceable>example.org</replaceable>/rpath2
xrootdAllowedWritePaths=/pnfs/<replaceable>example.org</replaceable>/wpath1:/pnfs/<replaceable>example.org</replaceable>/wpath2
..</programlisting>

      <para>
	A restart of the &door-xrootd; is required to make the changes
	take effect. As soon as any of the above options is set, all read or write
	requests to directories not matching the allowed path lists
	will be refused.
      </para>

    </section>


    <section id="cf-xrootd-sec-authz">
      <title>Token-based authorization</title>

      <para>
	The &xrootd; &dcache; implementation includes a generic
	mechanism to plug in different authorization handlers. The only
	plugin available so far implements token-based authorization
	as suggested in <ulink
	url="http://people.web.psi.ch/feichtinger/doc/authz.pdf"/>.
      </para>

      <para>
	The first thing to do is to setup the keystore. The keystore
	file basically specifies all RSA-keypairs used within the
	authorization process and has exactly the same syntax as in
	the native xrootd tokenauthorization implementation. In this
	file, each line beginning with the keyword
	<literal>KEY</literal> corresponds to a certain Virtual
	Organisation (VO) and specifies the remote public (owned by
	the file catalogue) and the local private key belonging to
	that VO. A line containing the statement <literal>"KEY
	VO:*"</literal> defines a default keypair that is used as a
	fallback solution if no VO is specified in token-enhanced
	&xrootd; requests. Lines not starting with the
	<literal>KEY</literal> keyword are ignored. A template can be
	found in
	<filename>${dCacheHome}/etc/keystore.template</filename>.
      </para>

      <para>
	The keys itself have to be converted into a certain format in
	order to be loaded into the authorization plugin. &dcache;
	expects both keys to be binary DER-encoded (Distinguished
	Encoding Rules for ASN.1). Furthermore the private key must be
	PKCS #8-compliant and the public key must follow the
	X.509-standard.
      </para>

      <para>
	The following example demonstrates how to create and convert a
	keypair using OpenSSL:
      </para>

      <screen><lineannotation>Generate new RSA private key</lineannotation>
&prompt-root; <userinput>openssl genrsa -rand 12938467 -out key.pem 1024</userinput>

<lineannotation>Create certificate request</lineannotation>
&prompt-root; <userinput>openssl req -new -inform PEM -key key.pem -outform PEM -out certreq.pem</userinput>

<lineannotation>Create certificate by self-signing certificate request</lineannotation>
&prompt-root; <userinput>openssl x509 -days 3650 -signkey key.pem -in certreq.pem -req -out cert.pem</userinput>

<lineannotation>Extract public key from certificate</lineannotation>
&prompt-root; <userinput>openssl x509 -pubkey -in cert.pem -out pkey.pem</userinput>
&prompt-root; <userinput>openssl pkcs8 -in key.pem -topk8 -nocrypt -outform DER -out <replaceable>new_private_key</replaceable></userinput>
&prompt-root; <userinput>openssl enc -base64 -d -in pkey.pem -out <replaceable>new_public_key</replaceable></userinput></screen>

      <para>
	Only the last two lines are performing the actual conversion,
	therefore you can skip the previous lines in case you already
	have a keypair. Make sure that you keystore file correctly
	points to the converted keys.
      </para>

      <para>
	To enable the plugin, it is necessary to add the following two lines to
	the file
	<filename>${dCacheHome}/etc/dcache.conf</filename>, so that
	it looks like
      </para>

      <programlisting>..
	xrootdAuthzPlugin=org.dcache.xrootd.security.plugins.tokenauthz.TokenAuthorizationFactory
	xrootdAuthzKeystore=<replaceable>Path_to_your_Keystore</replaceable>
	..</programlisting>

      <para>
	After doing a restart of &dcache;, any requests without
	an appropriate token should result in an error saying
	"<literal>authorization check failed: No authorization token
	found in open request, access denied.(error code:
	3010)</literal>".
      </para>

      <para>
	If both tokenbased authorization and read-only access are
	activated, the read-only restriction will dominate (local
	settings have precedence over remote file catalogue
	permissions).
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="cf-xrootd-sec-precedence">
      <title>Precedence of security mechanisms</title>

      <para>
	The previously explained methods to restrict access via
	&xrootd; can also be used in conjunction. The precedence
	applied in that case is as following:
      </para>

      <para>
	The permission check executed by the authorization plugin (if
	one is installed) is given the lowest priority, because it can
	controlled by a remote party. E.g. in the case of tokenbased
	authorization, access control is determined by the file
	catalogue (global namespace).
      </para>

      <para>
	To allow local site's administrators to override remote
	security settings, write access can be further restricted to
	few directories (based on the local namespace, the
	&pnfs;). Setting &xrootd; access to read-only has the highest
	priority, overriding all other settings.
