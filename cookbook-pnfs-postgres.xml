  <title>Moving the <pnfs/> Data from GDBM to PostgreSQL</title>
  
  <para>
    From version 1.6.6 of <dcache/> the distribution contains a version of the
    <pnfs/> server which uses a postgresql database to store the namespace
    information instead of gdbm database files. The following guide will aid in
    updating to this server and converting the data from the gdbm files to the
    postgresql database.

    <title>Preliminaries and Preparations</title>

    <para>
      Before converting the data and updating the server, a postgresql server
      should be installed on the machine the <pnfs/> server is running on. In
      principle it is possible to run it on a separate server, however, this
      will most likely result in degraded performance and is not supported by
      this documentation.

1. Make sure you have Postgres V8.x.x installed and running.
   You can download the source code from the official web site: http://www.postgresql.org/download and
   build it following the instruction: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.0/static/installation.html
   Here is a short version from that page:

      ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/pgsql
      gmake
      su
      gmake install
      adduser postgres
      mkdir /usr/local/pgsql/data
      chown postgres /usr/local/pgsql/data
      su - postgres
      /usr/local/pgsql/bin/initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
      /usr/local/pgsql/bin/postmaster -D /usr/local/pgsql/data >logfile 2>&1 &
      /usr/local/pgsql/bin/createdb test
      /usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql test


  

   If there is another Postgres installed on your machine, make sure root's path is 
   set so that executables, esp. psql, postmaster, and pg_ctl, are called from the
   V8.x.x Postgres that you intend to use for dCache. (You will be doing most of this
   as root). Another thing is to make sure that the various libpg.so libraries are 
   not invoked from the other Postgres distribution. "locate libpg.so" will show which
   ones are on your system. Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH for root to insure that the "pnfs" 
   Postgress libs are seen first! 

   Note that for performance reasons it is recommended that only one Postgres 
   be run on the pnfs server. 

# TYPE  DATABASE    USER        CIDR-ADDRESS          METHOD

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all         postgres                          ident sameuser
local   all         pnfsserver                        password
local   all         all                               md5
# IPv4 local connections:
host    all         all         127.0.0.1/32          md5
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all         all         ::1/128               md5


pg_ctl reload

2. Create postgres user with the name you will be using to run pnfs server.
   Make sure it has "CREATEDB" privilege.

      psql -U postgres template1 -c "CREATE USER johndoe with CREATEDB"

      dropuser pnfsserver

      createuser --no-adduser --createdb --pwprompt pnfsserver

3. Shutdown the PNFS server.


4. Download from dcache.org and unpack postgres version of PNFS software from the tarfile 
        tar xfz pnfs.3.1.10-f8.tgz
   Download from dcache.org and unpack the tar file pnfs-conversion-kit.tgz
       cd pnfs-conversion-kit

5. Get the PNFS database directory out of the way:
       mv /opt/pnfsdb/pnfs/databases  <replaceable>backupDir</replaceable>/databases

6. Now create the empty files with the original databases file names. These files will be used
   by pnfs server as the nameholders. Postgres creates a new database for each of the original 
   database files. If admin, data1, data2, ... dataN are the original database file
   names, then

        mkdir /opt/pnfsdb/pnfs/databases
        cd /opt/pnfsdb/pnfs/databases
	touch admin data1 data2 ... dataN

7. Scan all the databases using script v3_1_10-f4/scan.sh
        for example:
        cd v3_1_10-f4

        cp scan.sh /opt/pnfs.3.1.10/pnfs/tools/
        cd /opt/pnfs.3.1.10/pnfs/tools/

        ./scan.sh <replaceable>backupDir</replaceable>/databases/admin
        ...............


#! /bin/bash

if [ ! -d /tmp/Scan0 ] ; then
    mkdir /tmp/Scan0
fi

bn=`basename $1`

echo    "md3tool scan $1 > /tmp/Scan0/${bn}.scan"
./md3tool scan $1 > /tmp/Scan0/${bn}.scan 2>&1
grep -v "^ ID" /tmp/Scan0/${bn}.scan
echo    "md3tool scandir $1 > /tmp/Scan0/${bn}.scandir"
./md3tool scandir $1 > /tmp/Scan0/${bn}.scandir 2>&1
grep -v "^Scan" /tmp/Scan0/${bn}.scandir
echo    "md3tool scandirs $1 > /tmp/Scan0/${bn}.scandirs"
./md3tool scandirs $1 > /tmp/Scan0/${bn}.scandirs 2>&1
grep -v "^Dir" /tmp/Scan0/${bn}.scandirs




md3tool scan /opt/pnfs-databases-old/admin > /tmp/Scan0/admin.scan
 Total Objects : 75
 Directories
   inode  : 11
   data   : 21
   hash   : 22

   inode  : 8
   data   : 8
   hash   : 0

   inode  : 2

md3tool scandir /opt/pnfs-databases-old/admin > /tmp/Scan0/admin.scandir
 Scanning DB id : 0
   External Reference at 0 : 000100000000000000001060 for data
md3tool scandirs /opt/pnfs-databases-old/admin > /tmp/Scan0/admin.scandirs
 Scanning DB id : 0


        The script will put the logfiles into /tmp/Scan0 directory. Note that the 
	scan takes some time. 

  

8. Check if there are any errors in the logfiles
        *If you see any errors in the scan logs you can not proceed with the conversion!*
        *You must stop, investigate the problem and fix it first!*

    Various "grep -v" commands are useful for checking the logfiles, which can be fairly
    large. For example:
	grep -v "^ ID" /tmp/Scan0/db_name.scan
	grep -v ^Scan /tmp/Scan0/db_name.scandir
	grep -v ^Dir /tmp/Scan0/db_name.scandirs

    ...all produce a small amount of output (if no errors!), and also give useful 
    information, like the number of file records in the original database. 

9. If the scan was successful for *all* databases then run the conversion script for each database:

          export dbConnectString="user=pnfsserver password=test"

        cd ../v3_1_10-f8
        ./g2psql.sh <replaceable>backupDir</replaceable>/databases/admin
        ...............
   By default the program uses username "postgres" to connect to the postgres server. If you plan
   to use some other account to run the server you have to specify it using the shell environment:
        export dbConnectString="user=johndoe"


   The conversion script also takes a bit of time, but is fairly quick. In fact, you 
   may exceed Postgres's checkpointing capability, in which case edit the postgresql.conf
   file and increase the number of checkpoint_segments (for example from 3 to 10).

10. To speed up the conversion the program does not create the database key, so you have to do it
    in a separate step. For each database created during the conversion run script make-key.sh:
        ./make-key.sh admin
        ...............

        psql -U pnfsserver -c 'ALTER TABLE pnfs ADD primary key (pnfsid)' admin

	This also can take a while if the files were large.

11. Scan all converted databases using script v3_1_10-f8/scan.sh
        for example:
        cd v3_1_10-f8
        ./scan.sh /opt/pnfsdb/pnfs/databases/admin
        ...............

        The script will put the logfiles into /tmp/Scan1 directory

12.  Check if there are any errors in the logfiles
      *If you see any errors in the scan logs you can not proceed with the conversion!*
        *You must stop, investigate the problem and fix it first!*

13. Compare the logfiles from the directories  /tmp/Scan0 and /tmp/Scan1
        They *must* be identical!


14. Change the pnfs location in the configuration file /usr/etc/pnfsSetup
        pnfs=/opt/pnfs.3.1.10/pnfs  to   pnfs=/opt/pnfs.3.1.10-f8/pnfs

15. At that point you have everything ready to start the new server. Make sure that 
    you have changed the pnfs location name to /opt/pnfs.3.1.10-f8/pnfs in your 
    startup scripts pnfs/bin/pnfs and $pnfs/tools/pnfs.server, then execute 

	$pnfs/bin/pnfs start
