  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>
    &dcache; is a distributed storage solution.  It organises storage
    across computers so the combined storage can be used without the
    end-users being aware of on precisely which computer their data is
    stored; end-users see simply a large amount of storage.
  </para>

  <para>
    Because end-users need not know on which computer their data is
    stored, their data can be migrated from one computer to another
    without any interruption of service.  This allows &dcache; storage
    computers to be taken out of service or additional machines (with
    additional storage) to be added without interrupting the service
    the end-users enjoy.
  </para>

  <para>
    &dcache; supports requesting data from a tertiary storage system.
    A tertiary storage system typically uses a robotic tape system,
    where data is stored on a tape from a library of available tapes,
    which must be loaded and unloaded using a tape robot.  Tertiary
    storage systems typically have a higher initial cost, but can be
    extended cheaply by added additional tapes.  This results in
    tertiary storage systems being popular where large amounts of data
    must be read.
  </para>

  <para>
    &dcache; also provides many transfer protocols (allowing users to
    read and write to data).  These have a modular deployment,
    allowing &dcache; to support expanded capacity by providing
    additional front-end machines.
  </para>

  <para>
    Another performance feature of &dcache; is hot-spot data
    migration.  In this process, &dcache; will detect when a few file
    are being requested very often.  If this happens, &dcache; can
    make duplicate copies of the popular files on other computers.
    This allows the load to be spread across multiple machines, so
    increasing throughput.
  </para>

  <para>
    The flow of data within &dcache; can also be carefully controlled.
    This is especially important for large sites as chaotic movement
    of data may lead to suboptimal usage; instead, incoming and
    outgoing data can be marshaled so they use designated resources;
    allowing better throughput and guaranteeing end-user experience.
  </para>

  <para>
    &dcache; provides a comprehensive administrative interface for
    configuring the &dcache; instance.  This is described in the later
    sections of this book.
