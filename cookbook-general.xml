      The PNFS server, dCache server, and dCache client software
      have to be taken care of:

      <title>The dCache Server</title>
      
      <para>
        The major part of the dCache server softwar is written in
        Java. Therefore the Java Virtual Machine with 64 bit
        extension needs to be installed. It either is included in
        the regular Java distribution or additional packages have to
        be downloaded.

      <para>
        The <glossterm id="gl-dcap-library">dCap library</glossterm>
        and the command line tool <command>dccp</command> may be
        downloaded from <ulink
	  url="http://www.dcache.org/downloads.shtml">
	  http://www.dcache.org/downloads/</ulink> for several
        architectures. The source of the client software may also be
        downloaded from <ulink
	  url="http://www.dcache.org/downloads/cvs.shtml">
	  http://www.dcache.org/downloads/cvs.shtml</ulink> and
        compiled. As of this writing, this has not been tested for
        the Opteron architecture. Please, contact
        <email>support@dcache.org</email> when encountering any
        problems with this.

      <title>PNFS Server</title>
      
      <para>
        The current version of the PNFS server software is written
        in C and has never been compiled for any 64-bit
        architecture. Since a Java implementation is in preparation,
        there are no plans to do that. Therefore the PNFS server has
        to be run in compat mode.
