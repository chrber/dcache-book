  <title>&chimera;</title>

    <para>
      Since &dcache; is a distributed storage system, it provides a
      single-rooted file system view. &dcache; supports multiple
      namespace providers, while &chimera; is the one being used in
      the current version.
    </para>

    <para>
      The &chimera; filesystem may also be mounted by
      clients. Mounting can be achieved through following the steps
      described in the following section (assuming the system is
      configured as described in the installation instructions).
      Users may then access the meta data with regular filesystem
      operations, like <command>ls -l</command>, and by the
      &chimera;-specific operations described in the following
      sections. The files themselves may then be accessed with the
      &dcap; protocol.
    </para>

<section id="chimera-mount">
  <title>Mounting &chimera; through &nfs;</title>

  <para>
    &dcache; does not need the &chimera; filesystem to be mounted but
    a mounted file system is convenient for administrative access.
    This offers the opportunity to use OS-level tools like
    <command>ls</command> and <command>mkdir</command> for
    &chimera;. However, direct I/O-operations like
    <command>cp</command> are not possible, since the &nfs3; interface
    provides the namespace part only. This section describes how to
    start the &chimera; &nfs3; server and mount the name space.
  </para>

  <note>
    <para>
      &chimera; is available as the &cell-nfsv3; service and can be
      added to and edited in the &dcache;
      <firstterm>layout</firstterm> file (see <xref
      linkend="in-install-layout" />). &chimera; will be started
      automatically as &dcache; is started.
    </para>
  </note>

  <para>
     If you want to mount &chimera; for easier administrative access,
     you need to edit the <filename>/etc/exports</filename> file as
     the &chimera; &nfs; server uses it to manage exports. If this
     file doesn't exist it must be created.  The typical
     <filename>exports</filename> file looks like this:
  </para>

  <programlisting>/ localhost(rw)
/data
# or
# /data *.my.domain(rw)</programlisting>

  <para>
    Now you can mount &chimera; by
  </para>

  <screen>&prompt-root; <userinput>mount localhost:/ /mnt</userinput></screen>

  <para>
    and create the root of the &chimera; namespace which you can call
    <filename class="directory">data</filename>:
  </para>

  <screen>&prompt-root; <userinput>mkdir -p /mnt/data</userinput></screen>

  <para>
    If you don't want to mount chimera you can create the root of the &chimera; namespace by
  </para>

  <screen>&prompt-root; <userinput>&chimera-cli; Mkdir /data</userinput></screen>

  <para>
    You can now add directory tags.  For more information on tags see
    <xref linkend="chimera-tags"/>.
  </para>

  <screen>&prompt-root; <userinput>echo "chimera" | &chimera-cli; Writetag /data sGroup</userinput>
&prompt-root; <userinput>echo "StoreName sql" | &chimera-cli; Writetag /data OSMTemplate</userinput></screen>

  <section id="chimera-useDcap">
    <title>Using &dcap; with a mounted file system</title>

    <para>
      If you plan to use &dcap; with a mounted file system instead of
      the &url;-syntax (e.g. &prog-dccp;
      <filename>/data/file1</filename>
      <filename>/tmp/file1</filename>), you need to mount the root of
      &chimera; locally (remote mounts are not allowed yet). This will
      allow us to establish wormhole files so &dcap; clients can
      discover the &dcap; doors.
    </para>

    <screen>&prompt-root; <userinput>mount localhost:/ /mnt</userinput>
&prompt-root; <userinput>mkdir /mnt/admin/etc/config/dCache</userinput>

    <para>
      The default values for ports can be found in <xref
      linkend="rf-ports"/> (for &dcap; the default port is
      <literal>22125</literal>) and in the file
      <filename>/opt/d-cache/share/defaults/dcache.properties</filename>. They
      can be altered in
      <filename>/opt/d-cache/etc/dcache.conf</filename>

      When the configuration is complete you can unmount &chimera;:

  </section>

  <note>
    <para>
      Please note that whenever you need to change the configuration,
      you have to remount the root <literal>localhost:/</literal> to a
      temporary location like <filename

<section id="chimera-commands">
  <title>Communicating with &chimera; </title>

  <para>
    Many configuration parameters of &chimera; and the
    application specific meta data is accessed by reading, writing, or
    creating files of the form
    <filename>.(<replaceable>command</replaceable>)(<replaceable>para</replaceable>)</filename>.
    For example, the following prints the &chimera;ID of the file
    <filename>/data/some/dir/file.dat</filename>:
  </para>

  <screen>&prompt-user; <userinput>cat /data/any/sub/directory/'.(id)(file.dat)'</userinput>
0004000000000000002320B8 &prompt-user; </screen>
  <para>

    From the point of view of the &nfs; protocol, the file
    <filename>.(id)(file.dat)</filename> in the directory <filename
    class="directory">/data/some/dir/</filename> is read. However,
    &chimera; interprets it as the command <literal>id</literal> with
    the parameter <literal>file.dat</literal> executed in the
    directory <filename
    class="directory">/data/some/dir/</filename>. The quotes are
    important, because the shell would otherwise try to interpret the
    parentheses.
  </para>

  <para>
    Some of these command files have a second parameter in a third
    pair of parentheses. Note, that files of the form
    <filename>.(<replaceable>command</replaceable>)(<replaceable>para</replaceable>)</filename>
    are not really files. They are not shown when listing directories
    with <command>ls</command>. However, the command files are listed
    when they appear in the argument list of <command>ls</command> as
    in
  </para>

  <screen>&prompt-user; <userinput>ls -l '<filename>.(tag)(sGroup)</filename>'</userinput>
-rw-r--r-- 11 root root 7 Aug 6 2010 .(tag)(sGroup)</screen>

  <para>
    Only a subset of file operations are allowed on these special
    command files. Any other operation will result in an appropriate
    error. Beware, that files with names of this form might
    accidentally be created by typos.  They will then be shown when
    listing the directory.
  </para>

</section>

<section id="chimera-tags">
  <title>Directory Tags</title>

  <para>
    In the mounted &chimera; namespace, each directory can have a
    number of tags. The existing tags may be listed with
  </para>

  <screen>&prompt-user; <userinput>cat '<filename>.(tags)()</filename>'</userinput>
.(tag)(OSMTemplate)
.(tag)(sGroup)</screen>

  <para>
    and the content of a tag can be read with
  </para>

  <screen>&prompt-user; <userinput>cat '<filename>.(tag)(OSMTemplate)</filename>'</userinput>
StoreName myStore</screen>

  <para>
    A nice trick to list all tags with their contents is
  </para>

  <screen>&prompt-user; <userinput>grep "" $(cat  ".(tags)()")</userinput>
.(tag)(OSMTemplate):StoreName myStore
.(tag)(sGroup):STRING</screen>

  <para>
    Directory tags may be used within &dcache; to control which pools
    are used for storing the files in the directory (see <xref
    linkend="cf-pm-psu"/>). They might also be used by a
    <firstterm>tertiary storage system</firstterm> for similar
    purposes (e.g. controlling the set of tapes used for the files in
    the directory).
  </para>

  <para>
    Even if the directory tags are not used to control the behaviour
    of &dcache;, some tags have to be set for the directories where
    &dcache; files are stored. The installation procedure takes care
    of this: In the directory <filename
    class="directory">/data/</filename> two tags are set to default
    values:
  </para>

  <screen>&prompt-user; <userinput>cd /data/</userinput>
&prompt-user; <userinput>grep "" $(cat ".(tags)()")</userinput>
.(tag)(OSMTemplate):StoreName myStore
.(tag)(sGroup):STRING</screen>

  <para>
    The following directory tags appear in the &dcache; context:
  </para>

  <variablelist>
    <title>Directory Tags for &dcache;</title>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>OSMTemplate</term>

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  Contains one line of the form
	  <quote><literal>StoreName</literal>
	  <replaceable>storeName</replaceable></quote> and specifies
	  the name of the store that is used by &dcache; to construct
	  the <glossterm linkend="gl-storage_class">storage
	  class</glossterm> if the <glossterm
	  linkend="gl-hsm_type">&hsm; type</glossterm> is

    </varlistentry>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>&hsm;Type</term>

      <listitem>
	<para>
	  The <glossterm linkend="gl-hsm_type">&hsm; type</glossterm> is
	  normally determined from the other existing tags. E.g., if
	  the tag <literal>OSMTemplate</literal> exists, &hsm; type
	  <literal>osm</literal> is assumed. With this tag it can be
	  set explicitly. A class implementing that &hsm; type has to
	  exist. Currently the only implementations are
	  <literal>osm</literal> and <literal>enstore</literal>.
          </para>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>sGroup</term>

	<listitem>
          <para>
	    The storage group is also used to construct the <glossterm
	    linkend="gl-storage_class">storage Class</glossterm> if
	    the <glossterm linkend="gl-hsm_type">&hsm; type</glossterm>
	    is <literal>osm</literal>.

        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
	<term>cacheClass</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The cache class is only used to control on which pools the
            files in a directory may be stored, while the storage
            class (constructed from the two above tags) might also be
            used by the &hsm;. The cache class is only needed if the
            above two tags are already fixed by &hsm; usage and more
            flexibility is needed.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>&hsm;Instance</term>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    If not set, the &hsm; instance will be the same as the
	    &hsm; type. Setting this tag will only change the name as
	    used in the <glossterm linkend="gl-storage_class">storage
	    class</glossterm> and in the pool commands.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>
      There are more tags used by &dcache; if the &hsm; type
      <literal>enstore</literal> is used.

    <screen>&prompt-user; <userinput>echo '<replaceable>content</replaceable>' > '<filename>.(tag)(<replaceable>tagName</replaceable>)</filename>'</userinput></screen>

    <para>
      one has to take care not to treat the command files in the
      same way as regular files, because tags are different from files
      in the following aspects:
    </para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          The <replaceable>tagName</replaceable> is limited to 62
          characters and the <replaceable>content</replaceable> to 512
          bytes. Writing more to the command file, will be silently
          ignored.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
	  If a tag which does not exist in a directory is created by
          writing to it, it is called a <emphasis>primary</emphasis>
          tag.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
	  Tags are <emphasis>inherited</emphasis> from the parent
          directory by a newly created directory. Changing a primary
          tag in one directory will change the tags inherited from it
	  in the same way. Creating a new primary tag in a directory will
          not create an inherited tag in its subdirectories.
        </para>
        <para>
	  Moving a directory within the &chimera; namespace will not
          change the inheritance. Therefore, a directory does not
          necessarily inherit tags from its parent directory. Removing
          an inherited tag does not have any effect.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>
      If directory tags are used to control the behaviour of &dcache;
      and/or a tertiary storage system, it is a good idea to plan the
      directory structure in advance, thereby considering the
      necessary tags and how they should be set up. Moving directories
      should be done with great care or even not at all. Inherited
      tags can only be created by creating a new directory.
