  <title>&dcache; Webadmin-Interface</title>

  <para>
    This part describes how to configure the &cell-webadmin;-interface which
    is a replacement for the old &cell-httpd;-service and offers additional
    features to admins like sending admin-commands equal to those of &cell-admin; to chosen cells.
  </para>


  <para>
    The &cell-webadmin;-interface receives the information from
	&dcache; &cell-info; service as &xml; which are parsed and presented. For authentication and
	authorisation it offers usage of username/password (currently KAuth-File) or
	grid-certificates talking to &cell-gplazma;. It also offers a non-authenticated,
	read-only mode.
  </para>

  <para>
	If you are logged in as admin it is possible to send a command to multiple pools or
	a whole	poolgroup in one go. It is even possible to send a command to any &dcache;-Cell.
  </para>

  <para>
	From the technical point of view the &cell-webadmin;-interface uses a Jetty-Server which is embedded in an ordinary &dcache;-cell.
	It is using apache-wicket (a webfrontend-framework) and <abbrev>YAML</abbrev> (a CSS-Template Framework).
	The application is wired up by a Spring IOC-Container.
  </para>

  <section id="cf-webadmin-install">
    <title>Installation</title>
    <para>
      To enable your &dcache; to run the &cell-webadmin;-interface your system has to run
      the &cell-info; service. For the authenticated mode a configured &cell-gplazma; is also
      required (see also <xref linkend="cf-gplazma-webadmin-example"/>).
      The KAuth-File has to be on the same machine then the &cell-webadmin; for
      this to work. For a non-authenticated &cell-webadmin; you just need to add the &cell-webadmin;
      service to a domain and configure the port &cell-webadmin; will listen on - <varname>webadminHttpPort</varname>.
    </para>
    <para>
      For authenticated mode the host certificate has to be imported into the &dcache;-keystore.
      In the grid world host certificates are usually signed by national Grid-CAs. Refer to
      the documentation provided by the Grid-CA to find out how to request a certificate. To
      import them into the &dcache;-keystore use this command:
      <screen>&prompt-root; <userinput>&path-odb-n-s;dcache import hostcert</userinput></screen>
      Now you have to initialise your truststore (this is the certificate-store used
      for the SSL connections) by using this command:
      <screen>&prompt-root; <userinput>&path-odb-n-s;dcache import cacerts</userinput></screen>
      Webadmin-interface uses the same truststore as &cell-webDAV;, so maybe you can skip
      this step.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can enable the &cell-webadmin; interface by adding the service (&cell-webadmin;) to a domain.
    </para>
    <informalexample>
      <programlisting>[webadminDomain]
[webadminDomain/webadmin]
webadminDCacheInstanceName=coolName
webadminAuthenticated=true
webadminAdminGid=1000</programlisting>
    </informalexample>

    <para>
      The default value for the <varname>webadminHttpsPort</varname>
      is <literal>8444</literal> and for the
      <varname>webadminHttpPort</varname> it is
      <literal>8080</literal>. Have a look at the following example to
      see how to modify these values.
    </para>
    <informalexample>
      <programlisting>[webadminDomain]
[webadminDomain/webadmin]
webadminHttpsPort=8445
webadminHttpPort=8081
webadminDCacheInstanceName=coolName
webadminAuthenticated=true
webadminAdminGid=1000</programlisting>
    </informalexample>

	<para>
	  The most important value is <varname>webadminAdminGid</varname>, because it configures who is allowed to
	  alter dCache behaviour, which certainly should not be everyone:
	  <programlisting>#  ---- GID a user has to have to be considered an Admin of webadmininterface
#
#   When a user has this GID he can become an Admin for webadmininterface
webadminAdminGid=1000</programlisting>
      To see all webadmin specific property values have a look at
      <filename>&path-ods-usd;/defaults/webadmin.properties</filename>.

	  For information on &cell-gplazma; configuration have a look at
      <xref linkend="cf-gplazma"/> and for a special example
      <xref linkend="cf-gplazma-webadmin-example"/>.

      After startup of webadmin you can reach it via <uri>http://example.com:8080/webadmin</uri>.
      Since webadmin bases on the &cell-info; it takes some time until all values are populated,
      because &cell-info; needs to collect them first. It is recommended to let &cell-info; run on
      the same machine then &cell-webadmin;.
