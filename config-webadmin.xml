  <para>
    This part describes how to configure the webadmin-interface which
    is a replacement for the old &cell-httpd;-service and offers additional
    features to act as an adminservice to admins.
  </para>


  <para>
	The webadmin-interface uses a Jetty-Server which is embedded in an odinary &dcache;-cell.
	It is using apache-wicket (a webfrontend-framework) and <abbrev>YAML</abbrev> (a CSS-Template Framework).
	The application is wired up by a Spring IOC-Container. It receives the information from
	&dcache; infoservice as &xml; which are parsed and presented. For authentication and
	authorisation it offers usage of username/password(currently KAuth-File) or
	the grid-certificate talking to &cell-gplazma;. It also offers a non-authenticated,
	read-only mode.
  </para>

  <para>
	If you are logged in as admin it is possible to send a command to multiple pools or
	a whole	poolgroup in one go. It is even possible to send a command to any &dcache;-Cell.
  </para>

    <title>Installation</title>


    <para>
      To enable your &dcache; to run the webadmin-interface your system has to run
      the infoservice. For the authenticated mode a configured &cell-gplazma; is also
      required. For information on &cell-gplazma; configuration have a look at
      <xref linkend="cf-gplazma"/>. The KAuth-File has to be on the
      same machine then the webadmin for this to work.
    </para>
    <para>
      For authenticated mode a host certificate has to be imported into the &dcache;-keystore.
      In the grid world host certificates are usually signed by national Grid-CAs. Refer to
      the documentation provided by the Grid-CA to find out how to request a certificate. To
      import them into the &dcache;-keystore use this command:
      <screen>&prompt-root; <userinput>/opt/d-cache/bin/dcache import hostcert</userinput></screen>
      Now you have to initialise your truststore (this is the certificate-store used
      for the SSL connections) by using this command:
      <screen>&prompt-root; <userinput>/opt/d-cache/bin/dcache import cacerts</userinput></screen>
      Webadmin-interface uses the same truststore as &cell-webDAV;, so maybe you can skip
      this step.
    </para>
    <para>
      Now you can enable the webadmin-interface to run on your system by adding e.g. this
      to your layouts file:
      <screen>
	    [webadminDomain]
	    [webadminDomain/webadmin]
	    webadminHttpsPort=8443
	    webadminHttpPort=8080
	    webadminDCacheInstanceName=coolName
	    webadminAuthenticated=true
      </screen>
	</para>
	<para>
	  Another important value is this one, because it configures who is allowed to act as
	  an admin, which certainly should not be everyone:
	  <screen>
	   #  ---- GID a user has to have to be considered an Admin of webadmininterface
	   #
	   #   When a user has this GID he can become an Admin for webadmininterface
	   webadminAdminGid=1000
      </screen>
      To see all webadmin specific property values have a look at
      <code>${dcache.home}/share/defaults/webadmin.properties</code>

      After startup of webadmin you can reach it via <literal>http://example.com:8080/webadmin</literal>.
      Since webadmin bases on the &cell-info; it takes some time until all values are populated,
      because &cell-info; needs to collect them first. We are working on making this process
      faster in future releases. It is recommended to let info run on the same machine then
      webadmin.
