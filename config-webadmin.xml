<chapter id="cf-webadmin">

  <title>&dcache; Webadmin Interface</title>

  <para>
    This part describes how to configure the &serv-webadmin; service
    which runs inside the &domain-httpd; and offers additional
    features to admins like sending admin-commands equal to those of
    admin interface (CLI) to chosen cells or displaying billing plots.
  </para>

  <para>
	For authentication and authorisation it offers usage of
	username/password (currently the kpwd-Plugin) or grid
	certificate talking to &cell-gplazma2;. It also offers a
	non-authenticated read-only mode.
  </para>

  <para>
	If you are logged in as admin it is possible to send a command
	to multiple pools or a whole poolgroup in one go. It is even
	possible to send a command to any &dcache; cell.  Also, there
	is information like their size, their id and used space on
	linkgroups and spacetokens available.
  </para>

  <para>
	From the technical point of view the &serv-webadmin; service
	uses a Jetty-Server which is embedded in an ordinary
	&cell-httpd; cell.  It is using apache-wicket (a
	webfrontend-framework) and <abbrev>YAML</abbrev> (a
	CSS-Template Framework).
  </para>


  <section id="cf-webadmin-install">
    <title>Installation</title>

    <para>
      For the authenticated mode a configured &cell-gplazma; is
      required (see also <xref
      linkend="cf-gplazma-webadmin-example"/>). The user may either
      authenticate by presenting his grid certificate or by entering a
      valid username/password combination. This way it is possible to
      login even if the user does not have a grid certificate.  For a
      non-authenticated &serv-webadmin; service you just need to start
      the &cell-httpd; service.
    </para>

    <para>
      For the authenticated mode using a grid certificate the host
      certificate has to be imported into the &dcache;-keystore.  In
      the grid world host certificates are usually signed by national
      Grid-CAs. Refer to the documentation provided by the Grid-CA to
      find out how to request a certificate. To import them into the
      &dcache;-keystore use this command:
    </para>

    <screen>&prompt-root; <userinput>&path-odb-n-s;dcache import hostcert</userinput></screen>
    <para>
      Now you have to initialise your truststore (this is the
      certificate-store used for the SSL connections) by using this
      command:
    </para>
    <screen>&prompt-root; <userinput>&path-odb-n-s;dcache import cacerts</userinput></screen>
    <para>
      The &serv-webadmin; service uses the same truststore as
      &serv-webdav; service, so you can skip this step if you have
      &serv-webdav; configured with SSL.
    </para>

    <para>
      The default instance name is the name of the host which runs the
      httpdDomain and the default http port number is
      <literal>2288</literal> (this is the default port number of the
      &serv-httpd; service).  Now you should be able to have a
      read-only access to the webpage
      <uri>http://example.com:2288/webadmin</uri>.
    </para>
    <para>
      In the following example we will enable the authenticated mode.
    </para>
    <informalexample>
      <programlisting>[httpdDomain]
      authenticated=true</programlisting>
    </informalexample>

	<para>
	  The most important value is
	  <varname>webadminAdminGid</varname>, because it configures
	  who is allowed to alter &dcache; behaviour, which certainly
	  should not be everyone: 
	</para>
	<programlisting># # When a user has this GID he can become an Admin for the webadmin interface #
webadminAdminGid=1000</programlisting>
	<para>
	    To see all webadmin specific property values have a look
	    at
	    <filename>&path-ods-usd;/defaults/httpd.properties</filename>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  For information on &cell-gplazma; configuration have a look
	  at <xref linkend="cf-gplazma"/> and for a special example
	  <xref linkend="cf-gplazma-webadmin-example"/>.
