  <para>
    The raw information about all dCache activities can be found in
    <filename>&path-od-vld;/billing/<replaceable>YYYY</replaceable>/<replaceable>MM</replaceable>/billing-<replaceable>YYYY.MM.DD</replaceable></filename><footnote layout='opt'>
    <para>
	Filenames will always be relative to the &dcache; installation
      directory, which defaults to <filename>/opt/d-cache/</filename>.
    </para>
    </footnote>.
    A typical line looks like
  </para>

  <informalexample>
	
    <screen>05.31 22:35:16 [pool:<replaceable>pool-name</replaceable>:transfer] [000100000000000000001320,24675] myStore:STRING@osm 24675 474 true {GFtp-1.0 <replaceable>client-host-fqn</replaceable> 37592} {0:""}</screen>
  </informalexample>
    
  <para>
    The first bracket contains the pool name, the second the
    <glossterm linkend="gl-pnfs-id">&pnfs; ID</glossterm> and the size
    of the file which is transferred. Then follows the <glossterm
    linkend="gl-storage_class">storage class</glossterm>, the actual
    amount of bytes transferred, and the number of milliseconds the
    transfer took. The next entry is <literal>true</literal> if the
    transfer was a wrote data to the pool. The first braces contain
    the protocol, client FQN, and the client host data transfer listen
    port.  The final bracket contains the return status and a possible
    error message.
  </para>

  <para>
    The &dcache; web interface (described in <xref
      linkend="intouch-web"/>) contains under the menu point
    <quote>Actions Log</quote> summary information extracted from
    the information in the <filename>billing</filename>-directory.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    The accounting information can also be redirected into a
    database.

    There is also a nice little script which converts the billing
    files into something nice and neat. It can be found at
